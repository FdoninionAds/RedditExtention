I made this because every time I see a Hero Wars Dominion Era ad on Reddit, it annoys me. 
What this does is scan your Reddit page for posts with specific usernames and/ or domain names. 
When a domain name is found that matches one on your list, the element will be deleted the next time you scroll.
Feel free to take this code and do whatever you want with it. As far as I am concerned, I am, using this for personal reasons and figured others would want in on it.

To use this, you will need to create your own extension. A pretty simple process, but one I will walk you through now. Note that this is for Google Chrome. I have no idea if this works for Firefox, MS Edge, etc...
If it does not, I might update it later if I can be bothered.

--- CREATING A CHROME EXTENSION ---
1) Go to the URL: chrome://extensions/
2) Click 'load unpacked' in the top left corner.
3) Find the location of the file downloaded from this Repo. Make sure it is not compressed and is just a standard file.
4) Select the file and it should load into your extensions.
5) In the top right of Chrome is the extension button (a small jigsaw piece). Click this to find the extension you just made
6) Follow the instructions on the extension popup

I might update this later. I have added some comments to the code for people who want to change it. Originally, the code was a Python script that would also downvote whatever was on your list. 
The automatic downvote was removed because I do not want Reddit to find me using this. If you know how to code, you can add it yourself.
I am a big believer in advertisements as a method for a website to run which is why I made blocking ads/ posts a list system as opposed to blocking everything that is classified as an advertisement.
Feel free to change this system without complaint from me as I do not care about you sharing the same/ differing outlooks as me. 
I am aware there are likely issues with my code. I did not spend much time on it. I will see these issues and update the repo as I fix them as I use Reddit.

I am sure things are missing in this Read Me. I will add them if/ when I think of them.
